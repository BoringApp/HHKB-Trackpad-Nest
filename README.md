# Keyboard Trackpad Nest

A 3D printing `Keyboard-Trackpad-Nest` project can merge your keyboard and Apple Magic Trackpad into one piece. That will make you work like using a MacBook Pro keyboard-trackpad layout but have more options.

This project supports two different configurations:

- [HHKB Professional 2 + Apple Magic Trackpad 2](https://github.com/Leask/Keyboard-Trackpad-Nest/tree/main/HHKB)
- [Apple Magic Keyboard 3 + Apple Magic Trackpad 3](https://github.com/Leask/Keyboard-Trackpad-Nest/tree/main/Magic-Keyboard)

This project was designed in Blender. And I am providing all the `.blend` files and a printable `.stl` model. Feel free to make any tweaks and remix. To print this project, you will need a 3D printer that can print up to 30.5 cm * 26.5 cm.

If you have any problem, you can find me here: https://twitter.com/LeaskH/ .

This project is `NOT for COMMERCIAL use`.
