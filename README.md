# HHKB Trackpad Nest

A 3D printing `HHKB-Trackpad-Nest` project can merge your HHKB and Apple Magic Trackpad 2 into one piece. That will make you work like using a MacBook Pro keyboard-trackpad layout but with a fantastic HHKB.

This project was designed in Blender. And I am providing all the `.blend` files and a printable `.stl` model. Feel free to make any tweaks and remix. To print this project, you will need a 3D printer that can print up to 30.5 cm * 26.5 cm.

If you have any problem, you can find me here: https://twitter.com/LeaskH/ .

This project is `not for commercial use`.
